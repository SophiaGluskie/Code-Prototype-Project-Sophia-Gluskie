# Code-Prototype-Project-Sophia-Gluskie

**Project Introduction & General Information:**

This Git Repository contains all the files necessary to view my code prototype project. My project was created using Processing and consists of two animated visual artworks titled ‘Shifting Sand’ (artwork 1) and ‘Infinite Current’ (artwork 2) that draw inspiration from the movements and patterns of the sand and ocean currents. 

To create my artworks, I used a background image that I took myself on my iPhone 15, that was then overlayed my written code elements on top.

**Specific Notes - please take note of the following:**
- I coded and created these artworks on my 15 inch Macbook Pro. The size of each artwork is 1500 x 850 pixels which displays the complete artworks on my screen.
- 'Infinite Current' (artwork 2) includes an additive wave that displays differently each time the Processing file is run

**Key Features:**
- Background image
- Bezier function to create curvature design on artwork 1
- Sine wave function to create animated wave on artwork 1
- Circle function to create circular elements on artwork 2
- Additive wave function to create animated wave on artwork 2

**Setup & Usage:**

To setup both the visual artworks. Please follow the instructions below:
1. Please prepare to open the files on a suitable computer device (I created this on my 15 inch Macbook Pro)
2. Ensure you have Processing version 4.3 downloaded onto your computer
3. Open the project file
4. Download the folder titled 'Sand_artwork2' to view artwork 1
5. Drag this folder (Sand_artwork2) into your Processing folder that should be located in the 'Documents' folder on your computer
6. Open Processing
7. Click 'File', then 'Open' and open the correct artwork 1 file (Sand_artwork2)
8. The code should now be displayed on screen
9. Click the 'play' / 'run' button to load up the artwork
10. Please repeat steps 4-9 with the folder title 'Ocean_artwork_version3' to view artwork 2

**Project Status & Areas to Improve:**
- If I continue to develop this project further I would love to attempt my stretch goals which include adding a third artwork to the series and adding an audio element to all the artworks
